# The authority

This file specifies walnutbutter. The code follows it: where the two
disagree, this file is right and the code has a bug. A change to the system
is made here first, then carried into the code and its tests.

Byron and Cedric own the substance of it. Claude keeps it and the code in
step. §0 is **non-negotiable**. Every other section says whether it is
**kept** (the connectivity and signalling scaffolding, agreed on
September 10, 2026, refactored lightly as needed) or **open** (to be
respecified: the constants, the activation rule, the learning rule). An
open section currently describes what the code does today, so that editing
it is editing a working system; where it conflicts with §0, §0 wins and the
code is behind.

Notation: a neuron $j$ has potential $p_j$, threshold $\theta_j$, and firing
rate estimate $r_j$. A connection $i \to j$ has weight $w_{ij}$. Time $t$ is
in nominal milliseconds. Every symbol in small capitals is a constant from
§1 and from `src/walnutbutter/constants.py`.

## 0. The Strong Statement — non-negotiable

The following are non-negotiable in this system. Everything else is tunable
parameters with sweeps.

* The inputs are the outputs. An "input" neuron, a "hidden" neuron, and an
  "output" neuron are defined only with respect to where external
  connections exist. The neurons themselves operate identically.
* A neuron integrates delta functions to determine its potential and fires
  when the integral exceeds a threshold, at which point it resets. This is
  an integrate-and-fire neuron. Note that there is no leak, not even a lazy
  leak.
* A neuron firing is followed by an absolute refractory period during which
  the neuron ignores its inputs and does not integrate them. This is a
  feedback control mechanism and computational feature of the system.
* A neuron becomes eligible for dopamine release when it fires. Dopamine is
  the global reward used for reinforcement learning. It is produced locally
  and consumed globally. Local production initiates when the neuron returns
  online from its refractory period and fires again. Maximum dopamine is
  released when the neuron fires immediately after the refractory period.
  The amount of dopamine released exponentially decays with time from
  1 unit at time t_first_fired + refractory_period + epsilon.

## 1. Global constants — open

One value each, for the whole network. `constants.py` is their only home in
the code; the constructors, the clock, the Teacher and the command line all
read from it, and `tests/test_constants.py` fails if any path grows a
literal of its own.

### 1.1 The default network

| constant | value | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| ACROSS | 8 | cells across; the input row has one neuron per coded bit |
| ROWS | 10 | rows of cells; input at the bottom, output at the top |
| OMEGA | 0.2 | proportion of all connections that are small-world shortcuts, $0 \le \omega < 1$ |
| REACH | 2 | lattice wiring: every pair within this many unit distances connects |
| WEIGHT_RANGE | [−1, 1] | random weights are drawn uniformly from this range, and learning clips to it |
| WEIGHT_EPSILON | 0.001 | under `--positive-weights` the range becomes [ε, 1]: no inhibition |

### 1.2 The neuron and its clock

| constant | value | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| THRESHOLD | 0.25 | $\theta$ every neuron starts with |
| MINIMUM_POTENTIAL | −1 | floor on $p$: inhibition and carried-over charge go no lower |
| REFRACTORY | 5 ms | absolute refractory period |
| REFRACTORY_HOPS | 3 | the refractory period divided by the time a signal takes to travel one hop; not an integer, started at 3 |
| INTERVAL | 10 ms | spacing of inputs when no time is given |

### 1.3 Learning

| constant | value | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| RULE | dopamine | which learning rule runs: dopamine (§6) or reinforce (§6.7, factored out) |
| LR | 0.03 | learning rate |
| SIGMA | 0.1 | exploration noise: standard deviation added to each neuron's potential at every input |
| DOPAMINE_RELEASE_ALPHA, DOPAMINE_RELEASE_THETA | 2, 1 ms | shape and scale of the gamma density that gives the amount released against the refire delay past the refractory period |
| DOPAMINE_TAU | 20 ms | decay of the global dopamine value |
| DOPAMINE_EXPECTATION_TAU | 10 min | exponential window of the expected dopamine trace, which starts at 0 |
| DOPAMINE_ORDER | release-first | at a refire, release before the weight update (or update-first) |

The reinforce rule, factored out behind RULE = reinforce, keeps its own:

| constant | value | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| TARGET | reversed | what the output should show, derived from the input (§4.3) |
| CRITIC | row | how the reward is judged (§6.7) |
| ELIGIBILITY | perturb | what the reward acts on: the exploration noise, or a Hebbian ±1 |
| LATE | count | what a signal arriving after its target fired earns (§6.7) |
| BASELINE_RATE | 0.05 | per-epoch update of the running reward baseline |
| HOMEOSTASIS | 10⁻⁶ | per-epoch rate a threshold drifts toward its target firing rate; 0 = off |
| TARGET_RATE | 0.5 | firing rate homeostasis aims for |
| UNSTICK | 10⁻³ | per-epoch rate a stuck output's threshold moves toward UNSTICK_TARGET; 0 = off |
| UNSTICK_TARGET | 0.5 | firing rate the un-sticking aims for |
| THRESHOLD_RANGE | [−5, 5] | limits on where homeostasis and un-sticking may move a threshold |
| RATE_MEMORY | 0.01 | per-epoch update of $r_j$: about the last 100 epochs |
| STUCK_BELOW, STUCK_ABOVE | 0.01, 0.99 | a neuron with $r_j$ outside this band is stuck |
| WINDOW | 200 | epochs the reported moving-average accuracy spans (reporting only) |

## 2. The substance — kept

Walnut butter is a substance spread on the plane. Its density is neuron
density: butter spread at unit density puts one neuron per unit cell of a
hexagonal lattice. Butter spread near other butter connects (§3). The goal
is to create walnut butter, not to solve a particular task: a task is a way
of watching whether the substance is alive and learning.

Three containers build a network from it, all sharing the same neurons,
connections, signalling and learning:

- **The hex grid.** A rectangle of ACROSS × ROWS hexagonal cells, one neuron
  each, pointy-top, odd rows shifted half a cell. Row 0 is the top.
- **Hexagonal columns** (`--layers N`). The same field of cells extruded
  into columns of $N$ neurons in $\mathbb{R}^3$: a cell is one unit across,
  neighbouring cells are half a unit apart in the plane, the layers of a
  column an eighth of a unit apart. With one layer the stack *is* the hex
  grid, bit for bit.
- **The lattice / a spread** (`--nodes`). Neurons at $(x, y)$ positions in
  unit distances: a hexagonal lattice, a random scatter, or the positions a
  butter recipe describes.

A neuron may sit in several input and output zones at once; structures are
permissive, never artificially restricted.

## 3. Connectivity — kept

Every connection is one-way, from a source to a target, with its own weight.
Between two neurons $i$ and $j$ there are two connections, $i \to j$ and
$j \to i$, each with an independent weight. No neuron connects to itself.
Connections have ids from 1 in the order they are made, so a seed rebuilds
the same network.

### 3.1 The guaranteed neighbourhood

- **Hex grid.** Every neuron connects to its six neighbours (the first ring)
  and to the twelve neighbours of those neighbours (the second ring):
  eighteen local targets for an interior cell.
- **Columns.** Same position, never; horizontal distance $\le 1 + \varepsilon$
  (measured in the plane, ignoring height), always. The radius of one unit
  takes in a neuron's own column and the eighteen columns around it, in
  every layer.
- **Lattice / spread.** Every ordered pair within REACH units connects. At
  unit density with REACH = 2 that is the same eighteen neighbours.

### 3.2 Shortcuts

Everything further away is reached only by small-world shortcuts. With $L$
guaranteed connections, $S = \mathrm{round}\big(\omega L / (1 - \omega)\big)$
shortcuts are added so that they are the fraction OMEGA of all connections.
Each runs one way from a random neuron to a random neuron that is not
itself, not a guaranteed partner, and not already a target of the source.
The lattice and a spread have no shortcuts.

### 3.3 Weights

Every weight is drawn independently and uniformly from WEIGHT_RANGE, in
connection-id order from the seeded stream, unless a fixed weight is given
to all. Learning (§6) keeps every weight inside WEIGHT_RANGE.

## 4. Signalling — kept, on a schedule

### 4.1 The clock

Time is in nominal milliseconds. A signal takes one **hop** to travel a
connection, $h = \text{REFRACTORY} / \text{REFRACTORY\_HOPS}$ (Byron,
September 11, 2026; not an integer, started at 3). Each input has a time
$t_e$; the first is at 0 and by default each is INTERVAL after the last.
There is no other delay: the time component of signalling is carried by
the hop and the refractory period.

*Decided (September 11, 2026):* a wave is "everything that happens at time
$t$", not "everything one hop after the last wave". With a non-integer
ratio, refractory recovery and hop arrivals fall at different times, and a
second input can land mid-cascade. The queue is therefore a time-ordered
**schedule** of signals, and a wave is the batch at the front with the same
timestamp, including any external signals stamped for that moment.
Same-time signals sum within a wave before anyone fires, which keeps the
floor and the firing decision order-independent; signals one hop apart are
separate waves. Epochs stop being the unit: a cascade from one input can
still be running when the next input's signals join the schedule, so "the
queue empties, then the clock advances" no longer holds. Learning has its
own cadence (§6). Times are rounded to a nanosecond so that two signals
computed to arrive at the same moment are the same moment in both engines.

### 4.2 An epoch

An epoch is one input and the schedule run up to the next input's time, the
**horizon**, $t_e + \text{INTERVAL}$ by default. Signals due at or after the
horizon wait for the next epoch. An input may not be given a time before
the horizon the schedule has already run to. In order:

1. **Reset.** Every neuron's fired-this-epoch state is cleared. Potentials
   are kept (`--discharge` zeroes them instead). Spike times are kept: the
   refractory period outlives the epoch. Signals in flight stay scheduled.
2. **Input.** The pattern is placed on the input neurons (§4.3), stamped
   $t_e$.
3. **Explore.** Each potential is nudged by the exploration noise (§6.1),
   floored at MINIMUM_POTENTIAL.
4. **Run.** The schedule runs wave by wave (§4.4) until the horizon; a
   neuron that refires learns as it fires (§6).
5. **Report.** The output is read (and, under the reinforce rule, scored
   and reinforced, §6.7).

### 4.3 Input and output

The network's input is its bottom row (the bottom layer, for columns); its
output is its top row (top layer). Per §0 the neurons are the same
everywhere; only the external connections differ. An input is $k$ =
ACROSS / 2 raw bits, drawn as fair coin flips from the seeded stream (or
given). They are **complement-coded**, the bits followed by their
negations, so $2k$ bits reach the row and exactly half of it fires whatever
the raw bits. The coded bits are then **permuted** by a random permutation
drawn once per network and fixed for its life: place $i$ along the row
shows coded bit $\pi(i)$. With an error-correcting code (`--ecc`), 4 data
bits are first encoded to 7 (Hamming) or 6 (parity) before complement
coding.

The neurons whose bit is 1 are **forced** to fire at $t_e$, refractory
period permitting. A neuron forced this epoch is marked as such, which only
the reinforce rule (§6.7) consults.

### 4.4 Waves

Firing is queued, never recursive. A wave is every event scheduled for one
time $t$: the signals arriving, and the stimulus if an input lands then. It
has two phases:

1. **Deliver.** Every arriving signal $i \to j$ delivers $w_{ij}$ to $j$
   (§5.1). Then every neuron touched this wave settles: its potential is
   floored at MINIMUM_POTENTIAL, so the floor acts on the wave's summed input
   and the result does not depend on the order the signals arrived in.
2. **Fire.** Every forced neuron fires unless refractory; then every touched
   neuron whose potential now meets its threshold, and is not refractory,
   fires (§5.2). Each firing neuron's active outgoing connections are
   scheduled for $t + h$. The refires in the wave then learn (§6).

A neuron may fire any number of times, the refractory period permitting; a
tight loop of about REFRACTORY_HOPS hops can bring a neuron's own spike
back to refire it. A refractory neuron ignores every signal, forced
stimulus included; the delivery is still recorded as such. Each connection
stamps the time of the last signal its target actually integrated: that is
the only trace of activity the target has (§6.4).

## 5. Activation rule — open

Per §0, the neuron is integrate-and-fire with an absolute refractory
period. There is no leak, not even a lazy leak.

### 5.1 Integration

A neuron integrates delta functions: a signal of weight $w$ arriving at
time $t$ adds to the potential, and nothing else ever changes it:

$$p \leftarrow p + w .$$

Inhibition ($w < 0$) pushes the potential down, and once per wave the floor
applies: $p \leftarrow \max(p, \text{MINIMUM\_POTENTIAL})$. Sub-threshold
charge is kept for as long as it takes; it does not decay.

### 5.2 Firing

A neuron fires in a wave iff $p \ge \theta$ and it is not refractory. The
spike resets it and is remembered, along with the spike before it:

$$p \leftarrow 0, \qquad t_{\text{prev}} \leftarrow t_{\text{fired}}, \qquad t_{\text{fired}} \leftarrow t .$$

A forced input neuron fires at its input's time regardless of $p$ and
$\theta$, refractory period permitting.

### 5.3 Refractory period

A neuron that fired at $t_{\text{fired}}$ is refractory while
$t < t_{\text{fired}} + \text{REFRACTORY}$. While refractory it ignores every
signal, does not integrate it, and cannot be forced. This is a feedback
control mechanism and computational feature of the system (§0).

## 6. Learning rule — open

Per §0: a neuron becomes eligible for dopamine release when it fires.
Dopamine is the global reward used for reinforcement learning. It is
produced locally and consumed globally.

*Decided (Byron, September 11, 2026):* Learning happens when a neuron that
previously fired fires again and is proportional to the global dopamine
value. We can take care of this when the neuron fires. The strategy of
REINFORCE remains the same as much as we can keep it with the global
dopamine reinforcer.

*Decided (Byron, September 12, 2026):* the dopamine eligibility is
calculated both locally and lazily. It is a property of a neuron. Signals
are NOT traced back to their ancestors. The only trace available to the
neuron is the activity across its synapses.

*Decided FOR NOW (Byron, September 12, 2026):* the eligibility is the same
for all of a neuron's weights. For now, dopamine is released and then all
weights move together. *Open question:* whether the dopamine release or the
weight update should happen first.

### 6.1 Exploration

At every input, every neuron $j$ (inputs included) draws
$\xi_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ with $\sigma$ = SIGMA and adds it to
its potential, floored. Tunable; 0 switches it off. Both engines draw from
the same Box-Muller stream, so a seed gives the same noise whichever engine
runs.

### 6.2 Release

A neuron whose previous spike was at $t_{\text{prev}}$ and which fires
again at $t$ (necessarily $t \ge t_{\text{prev}} + \text{REFRACTORY}$), a
delay $\delta = t - t_{\text{prev}} - \text{REFRACTORY}$ past the end of its
refractory period, releases the gamma density of that delay (Byron,
September 12, 2026, replacing the exponential
$e^{-\delta / \text{DOPAMINE\_RELEASE\_TAU}}$):

$$d_j = \frac{\delta^{\alpha - 1} e^{-\delta / \theta}}{\Gamma(\alpha)\,\theta^{\alpha}},
\qquad \alpha = \text{DOPAMINE\_RELEASE\_ALPHA} = 2,\ \theta = \text{DOPAMINE\_RELEASE\_THETA} = 1\text{ ms}.$$

With $\alpha = 2$ an instant refire releases nothing, the release peaks at
$1/e$ one millisecond past the end of the refractory period, and it decays
from there. *Tension with §0*, which says maximum dopamine is released when
the neuron fires immediately after the refractory period: with this
$\alpha$ the maximum comes $(\alpha - 1)\theta$ later, and $\alpha = 1$
recovers §0's exponential. For Byron and Cedric to settle in §0. A neuron's
first ever spike releases nothing.
Forced neurons are neurons (§0): a forced refire releases and learns like
any other.

### 6.3 The global value and the expectation

The global dopamine value $D(t)$ is a pool every release adds to, decaying
lazily with DOPAMINE_TAU: $D(t) = D(t_0)\, e^{-(t - t_0)/\tau_D}$ between
events. Reading it does not deplete it.

*Decided (Byron, September 12, 2026):* instead of a baseline, actual
reinforcement learning with an internal expectation, `dopamine_expected`,
calculated globally under the assumption that dopamine is global. For now,
the actual counts (not biologically realistic) of dopamine to date divided
by the current time. The reinforcement is proportional to
(dopamine − dopamine_expected), not to dopamine.

*Decided (Byron, September 12, 2026), replacing the counts-over-time
estimator, which could only creep:* start with dopamine_expected = 0 and use
an exponential decay window of 10 minutes for the expected dopamine trace.
At every wave, after the wave's releases and updates, the expectation moves
toward the value by the fraction of the window that has elapsed since the
last wave:

$$E \leftarrow E + \big(1 - e^{-\Delta t / \tau_E}\big)\,(D(t) - E),
\qquad A(t) = D(t) - E ,$$

with $\tau_E$ = DOPAMINE_EXPECTATION_TAU and $A$ read before the move. This
may start off slow but may eventually get us where we are trying to get.

### 6.4 Eligibility — for now

One value per neuron, computed when it refires, from nothing but its own
spikes and the stamps on its synapses (§4.4): $e_j = d_j$, its own release
amount. A tight refire is both the biggest release and the biggest
eligibility.

### 6.5 The update — gated, for now

When neuron $j$ refires at $t$, every incoming connection $i \to j$ that
carried a signal $j$ integrated since its previous spike (the gate,
$x_i = 1$; otherwise $x_i = 0$) moves together:

$$w_{ij} \leftarrow \mathrm{clip}\big(w_{ij} + \text{LR} \cdot A(t) \cdot e_j \cdot x_i,\ \text{WEIGHT\_RANGE}\big).$$

This keeps REINFORCE's shape, presynaptic activity × postsynaptic
eligibility × global signal, with the global signal now $A(t)$.

### 6.6 Order within a wave

All the refires in one wave are handled together: their releases are
computed, then (DOPAMINE_ORDER = release-first) added to the pool before
$A(t)$ is read and the updates applied, or (update-first) after. Release
first lets a neuron's own release count toward what it consumes; update
first keeps the signal strictly what others released. A switch, to be
swept.

### 6.7 The reinforce rule — factored out

RULE = reinforce is the rule of the pre-alpha, kept for comparison and run
by the Teacher on a trained problem (§8). One scalar reward per epoch: the
**row** critic scores the fraction of output neurons whose fired state this
epoch matches the target pattern (decoded critics read the row as a code
word first). A running baseline $b$ (BASELINE_RATE) gives the advantage
$A = R - b$. For every connection $i \to j$ that carried a signal this
epoch into a neuron $j$ not forced this epoch,
$w_{ij} \leftarrow \mathrm{clip}(w_{ij} + \text{LR} \cdot A \cdot e_j)$ with
$e_j = \xi_j/\sigma$ (ELIGIBILITY = perturb) or $\pm 1$ by whether $j$ fired
(hebb). LATE says what a signal arriving after its target fired earns:
count, ignore, or depress. The Teacher also keeps each unforced neuron's
firing rate ($r_j$, RATE_MEMORY) and drifts thresholds toward TARGET_RATE
(HOMEOSTASIS), nudging stuck outputs faster (UNSTICK), within
THRESHOLD_RANGE. Under RULE = dopamine the Teacher only scores and reports;
the network learns by §6.2–6.6.

### 6.8 What is reported

Spikes to date, the neurons fired this epoch, the dopamine value and its
expectation, releases and updates to date; the score of every epoch, its
mean to date, and an exponential moving average over about WINDOW epochs;
and a per-epoch trace file of epoch, time, dopamine, expected and score.
The window colours every neuron by the time of its last spike, hot (red)
at the end of the epoch cooling to blue over an epoch's length, and Space
pauses the free run at the end of an epoch to show its trace, a raster of
every spike. The network runs forever: these are read as health, not
convergence, and drift is normal.

## 7. Invariants the scaffolding guarantees — kept

- **Two engines, one network.** The object engine (neurons and a queue of
  waves) and the array engine (numpy vectors, a scipy sparse matrix) run the
  same network: same ids, same firing wave by wave, same weights to
  $10^{-12}$, and `tests/test_arrays.py` runs them side by side. A new rule
  is implemented in both and must pass the same tests.
- **A seed is the whole run.** Shortcuts, weights, permutation, inputs and
  exploration noise all come from the seed's stream, in both engines.
- **Checkpoints round-trip.** A checkpoint rebuilds the network from its
  seed and settings and reloads its weights, thresholds, clock, spike
  times, synapse stamps, signals in flight and dopamine, in either engine.
- **The network keeps living.** There is no training run and no evaluation
  run, only one run that keeps going; a rule may not assume an end.

## 8. Problems — open

A problem is what a network is asked to do and how it is watched doing it:
the layout, the inputs, and whether anything outside the network trains it.
`--problem` picks one; PROBLEM (§1) is the default.

- **reversal** (default today). The 8 × 10 hex grid; 4 random bits,
  complement-coded and permuted onto the bottom row; the top row is taught
  to show the bottom row reversed by a Teacher with a target and a critic
  (§6.2). The task of the pre-alpha, kept as the baseline.
- **sustain_inputs** (Byron, September 12, 2026). The same 16 inputs will
  be used across 8 neurons. However, this network is not trained
  externally: the neurons will utilize the new eligibility rule (§6).

  *The training epoch (Byron, September 12, 2026):* the sustain_inputs task
  receives an input on the same forced neurons, reverberates for 20
  milliseconds, and the same inputs (the inputs are the outputs) are read
  so we have a trace of the "score"; the previous Teacher metric computes
  the score even though it is not used for reinforcement. Time or epoch
  number, expected dopamine value, and score are recorded for each
  training epoch.

  *Claude's reading of the read:* the outputs are the input row, the target
  is the input pattern itself (copy), and a neuron is read as on if it
  fired within the last refractory period before the read at the end of
  the 20 ms, so the forced spike itself does not count and only a
  sustained neuron scores. The score is the row critic: the fraction of
  input neurons whose read state matches the pattern. Nothing outside the
  network moves a threshold (homeostasis and un-sticking off). The record
  goes to a CSV next to the checkpoint: epoch, time, dopamine, expected,
  score.
