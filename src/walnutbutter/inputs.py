"""Input patterns for the network.

The network's input is its input zone (AUTHORITY.md §4.3). A pattern is one
boolean per place in the zone; the neurons whose bit is 1 are forced to fire
in wave 0.

Patterns are complement-coded: the raw bits are followed by their negations,
so 12 raw bits become 24 bits and exactly half of the input zone fires no
matter what the raw bits are.
