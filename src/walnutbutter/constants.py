"""Every global constant of walnutbutter, in one place.

These are the defaults the constructors, the neuron's clock, the Teacher and
the command line all read from: change a value here and every path follows.
They are the physics of the substance (what a neuron needs to fire, how fast
it leaks, how learning moves a weight) and the shape of the default network.
Lattice geometry (cell spacing, row spacing, the guaranteed radius of a
column) is not tunable and stays with the lattice that owns it; the format
fallbacks for old checkpoints stay in persistence.py, because they record
what those files meant when they were written, not what the default is now.

The clock values live here but run from `Neuron.refractory` and
`Neuron.refractory_hops`, the class attributes the command line sets (and
restores) per run.
