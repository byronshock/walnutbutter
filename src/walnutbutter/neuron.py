    """A leaky integrate-and-fire neuron with an absolute refractory period, on a clock in nominal milliseconds.

    AUTHORITY.md §0 and §5: the neuron integrates delta functions (a signal
    adds its weight to the potential), the potential leaks with time
    constant `tau` (lazily: nothing happens to a quiet neuron, and when a
    signal arrives the potential is first decayed for the time since it was
    last brought up to date), and it fires when the potential reaches its
    threshold, and resets. A neuron that fired within the last `refractory`
    milliseconds ignores every signal, forced stimulus included. It
    remembers its last two spike times: the gap between them is what its
    dopamine release depends on (dopamine.py). `refractory` and
    `refractory_hops` are global properties of neurons, one value for the
    whole network; a signal takes `hop()` milliseconds to travel a connection.
