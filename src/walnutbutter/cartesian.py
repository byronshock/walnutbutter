"""A population of neurons at Cartesian positions, with no grid structure.

Positions are measured in *unit distances*: one unit is the natural scale of
the network, the step between neighbouring cells in the hex mesh, and a
population can span many of them.

By default the neurons form a hexagonal lattice of `across` x `rows` points
at unit spacing (pointy-top: odd rows shifted half a unit right, rows
sqrt(3)/2 apart), centred on the origin, so each neuron's six nearest
neighbours are exactly one unit away. With `layout="random"`, `count`
neurons are instead placed uniformly at random inside a rectangular region
of `width` x `height` units. Neurons added with coordinates go exactly
there, inside the region or not. Connections are not made here: the neurons
are placed, and how they connect (typically by distance) is a separate
decision.
