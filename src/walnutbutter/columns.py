"""Hexagonal columns in R3: the prespread butter.

The plane is tiled with hexagonal cells, one neuron per cell, and every cell
is extruded into a **column** of `layers` neurons. The whole thing is one
unit across a cell: neurons sit half a unit apart in the plane, and the
layers of a column an eighth of a unit apart in z (a quarter of the cell
spacing, so a column reads as a compact stack, much closer than
neighbours). The guaranteed radius of one unit (plus epsilon) takes in a
neuron's six neighbours in its layer and their second ring, the same
eighteen cells the hex grid has always wired.

Connection rule (Byron's, September 10, 2026):

    same position:                                 never
    horizontal distance <= 1 + epsilon:            always
    otherwise:                                     small-world shortcuts only (omega)

The distance is measured in the plane only, so the guarantee holds at any
height: a neuron is wired to every neuron of its own column and of the
eighteen columns around it, in every layer. Everything further away is
reached only by shortcuts, drawn as on the grid: random source to random
non-neighbour target until they are the fraction omega of all connections.

The input butter is the bottom layer and the output butter the top layer.
With one layer the two coincide, and the network keeps the grid's
convention (bottom row in, top row out) so that a one-layer stack is the
hex grid itself: the same neurons, the same connections, and with the same
seed the same shortcuts, weights and permutation.
