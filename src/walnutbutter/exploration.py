"""Exploration noise, drawn the same way by both engines.

Each epoch every neuron's potential is nudged by a Gaussian draw. Both
engines take their draws from the same `random.Random` stream of uniforms
and apply the Box-Muller transform to pairs, so a seed gives the same
noise whichever engine runs the network: the object engine does the
arithmetic per pair in Python, the array engine on the whole vector at
once. (`random.gauss` was not used because it caches a spare draw across
calls, which no vector version could reproduce.)
