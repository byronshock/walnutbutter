"""Dopamine: the reward, produced locally by refiring neurons and consumed globally (AUTHORITY.md §0, §6).

A neuron whose previous spike was at t_prev and which fires again at t
releases according to the gamma density of its delay d = t - t_prev -
refractory past the end of its refractory period, d^(alpha-1) exp(-d/theta)
/ (Gamma(alpha) theta^alpha), averaged over the hop that follows the delay
(the schedule's own resolution): the gamma mass in [d, d + hop) over hop.
That is the density itself as the hop shrinks, and it stays finite for
alpha < 1, where the density is infinite at zero delay and an instant
refire is the common case. With alpha 2 and theta 1 ms the release is
about 0.3 for an instant refire, peaks a little later, then decays. The
releases pool into one global value that decays lazily with `tau` and is
read without being depleted. The network's expectation of it is an
exponential moving average of the value with time constant
`expectation_tau` (10 minutes by default), starting from 0, brought up to
date at every wave (Byron, September 12, 2026; §6.3). The reinforcement is
proportional to the value minus the expectation.

Learning happens at the refire, with the wave: the refires in a wave
release together, then every incoming connection of each refiring neuron
that carried a signal it integrated since its previous spike moves by
lr * (value - expectation) * release (§6.4-6.6). `order` says whether the
wave's releases join the pool before the value is read (release-first,
default) or after (update-first). With `punish` (default on), an input
neuron whose bit this epoch is 0, one that should not fire, has the sign of
its update reversed when it refires: above-expected dopamine punishes it
for firing instead of rewarding it (Byron, September 12, 2026), and
`punish_gain` times as hard as a reward. Its release is unchanged; hidden
and forced neurons are unchanged. `decay` is the fraction every weight
moves toward zero each epoch: synapses that forget on their own, so that
sustained activity has to be earned (AUTHORITY.md §6.8). The object engine's update is `learn()`
below; the array engine does the same arithmetic on vectors (arrays.py).
