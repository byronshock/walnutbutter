"""The Teacher: scores a trained problem's output every epoch, and runs the reinforce rule when asked.

Two rules exist (AUTHORITY.md §6). The default, **dopamine**, lives in
dopamine.py and runs inside the schedule as neurons refire; under it the
Teacher only scores and reports. The **reinforce** rule of the pre-alpha,
factored out behind `rule="reinforce"`, is the rest of this module.

The top row is the network's output. For each epoch a target pattern is
derived from the input pattern (by default its reverse) and the reward is
the fraction of output neurons that match it.

Nothing is traced back through the network. Instead each epoch:

1. **Explore.** Every neuron starts the epoch with a small random potential
   (Gaussian, standard deviation `sigma`), so the same input produces
   slightly different cascades from one epoch to the next.
2. **Run** the epoch and score it. The **advantage** is the reward minus a
   running average of recent rewards: how much better or worse than usual.
3. **Reinforce.** Every connection that carried a signal (its source fired)
   into a neuron that was not a forced input is moved by
   `lr * advantage * eligibility`, where the eligibility is the target's
   exploration noise (normalised).

**Late signals.** A signal that arrives after its target has already fired
is dropped on delivery (Neuron.receive) and has no effect on the epoch, yet
by default its connection is still updated: the rule is local, pre fired
and post fired in the same epoch, and the global reward says whether that
coincidence was good. Strictly that is a reward-modulated Hebbian term
riding on the perturbation estimator, a bias with respect to the reward
gradient, but it is the biological shape of the rule (local eligibility,
global signal) and on the 8x10 reversed task it learned faster on every
seed tried (100k epochs: last-tenth 0.76-0.91 with late signals against
0.61-0.75 without). `late` chooses what a late signal earns: "count" (the
default, the same update as one that landed), "ignore" (nothing: the
node-perturbation estimator proper, only the signals that landed) or
"depress" (the opposite update, the shape of spike-timing-dependent
plasticity, where a presynaptic spike after the postsynaptic one weakens
the synapse). A neuron nudged towards firing in an
   epoch that turned out better than usual gets stronger inputs from the
   neurons that fed it; in a worse epoch, weaker.

This is the REINFORCE / node-perturbation estimator of the reward gradient,
a three-factor rule: presynaptic activity x postsynaptic perturbation x
global reward. With `eligibility="hebb"` the perturbation is replaced by a
plain Hebbian term (+1 if the target fired, -1 if not) and no noise is
injected, which is the classic reward-modulated Hebbian rule.

Forced inputs are never adjusted and weights are kept within the grid's
weight_range, [-1, 1] by default.

**Homeostasis.** A neuron whose input sits far from its threshold is never
flipped by the exploration noise, gets no learning signal, and stays "stuck"
on or off. Every neuron therefore tracks its own firing rate and nudges its
threshold toward a target rate each epoch: firing too often raises the
threshold, too rarely lowers it. Neurons forced in wave 0 this epoch are
left out of both, exactly as reinforcement leaves their incoming weights
alone: their firing was not the network's doing. An unforced input neuron
is an ordinary neuron and is treated as one. The default
rate of 1e-6 toward a target of 0.5 is a very slow drift (a fully stuck
neuron moves its threshold by about 0.0006 per thousand epochs, so the
effect belongs to runs of millions of epochs); a rate of 0 switches it off. Thresholds may go negative, within `THRESHOLD_RANGE`.
